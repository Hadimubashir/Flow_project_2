 **# SomeContract: A Move-Powered Smart Contract**

**Welcome to SomeContract, a smart contract designed to streamline your blockchain interactions.** This contract is written in Move, a secure and expressive language built for the Move Virtual Machine (VM). Let's dive into its key components:

**## Contract Structure:**

**- SomeStruct:**
    - Provides a public framework for data organization.
    - Variables:
        - `a` (String): Publicly settable for flexible data input.
        - `b` (String): Publicly accessible for seamless data retrieval.
        - `c` (String): Restricted to contract-level interactions, ensuring data integrity.
        - `d` (String): Self-restricted for secure internal operations.
    - Functions:
        - `publicFunc()`: Open for all to interact with.
        - `contractFunc()`: Reserved for contract-level actions.
        - `privateFunc()`: Confined to internal contract logic.
        - `structFunc()`: A public function residing within the struct, marked as "AREA 1" for future exploration.

**- SomeResource:**
    - Represents a valuable resource with defined access and modification rules.
    - Variables:
        - `e` (Int): Publicly accessible for transparent resource management.
    - Functions:
        - `resourceFunc()`: A function designed for resource-specific operations, marked as "AREA 2" for further development.

**- Public Functions:**
    - `createSomeResource()`: Empowers you to generate instances of SomeResource, unlocking its functionalities.
    - `questsAreFun()`: A public function with exciting potential, marked as "AREA 3" for future enhancements.

**## Main Module:**
    - Imports the SomeContract module for seamless integration.
    - Includes a `main()` function, marked as "AREA 4" for potential expansion.

**## How to Use:**

1. **Deploy SomeContract:** Initiate its functionality on the Move VM, laying the foundation for interaction.
2. **Execute Functions:**
    - Call `createSomeResource()` to bring SomeResource to life.
    - Embark on engaging quests with `questsAreFun()`.
    - Explore additional functions to tailor the contract to your specific needs.
